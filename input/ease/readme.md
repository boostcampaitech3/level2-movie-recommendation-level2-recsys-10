## To use
### Data
- Implicit Data between User and Item (traing_ratings.csv)
    - rows : observation-wise
    - cols : 'user', 'item', 'time'

- (optional) if you wanna use Genre filtering, You need item-genre data.

- Couldn't Make it.

### Run
- Too Simple to create pytorch-template. So, I decided to make only jupyter notebook file.
